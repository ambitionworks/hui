# Hui
(pronounced: hū-ē, **hyoo**-ee or like [Huey Lewis and The News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB5YkmjalDg))

A minimal collection of Laravel Blade components to assist in building composable and consistent server-rendered UI.

## Installation

**Please note:** Installation should only be performed on a fresh Laravel project, as it may clobber certain files such as `resources/css/app.css` or `webpack.mix.js`.

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require ambitionworks/hui
```

You can then run the install command:

```bash
php artisan hui:install
```
